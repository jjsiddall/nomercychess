He is now forced to play 7..._ x _; as experience has shown; thus bringing up to notice three things. First; the complete development of the opening has taken only seven moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional cases. As a rule; eight should be enough.) Second; Black has  been compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight; but as a compensation he has isolated White's _ _ _ and doubled a Pawn. (This; at such an early stage of the game; is rather an advantage for White; as the Pawn is doubled towards the center of the board.) Third; White by the exchange brings up a Pawn to control the square _ 4; puts Black on the defensive; as experience will show; and thus keeps _the initiative_; an unquestionable advantage.[1] The strategically principles expounded above are the same for all the openings; only their tactical application varies according to the circumstances.

Before development has been completed no piece should be moved more than once; unless it is essential in order to obtain either material advantage or to secure freedom of action._ The beginner would do well to remember this; as well as what has already been stated: viz.; _bring out the Knights before bringing out the Bishops_." },

The proper way; generally; in an ending; is to have your Pawns on squares of opposite color to that of your own Bishop. When you have your Pawns on squares of the same color the action of your own Bishop is limited by them; and consequently the value of the Bishop is diminished; since the value of a piece can often be measured by the number of squares it commands. While on this subject; I shall also call attention to the  fact that it is generally preferable to keep your Pawns on squares of the same color as that of the opposing Bishop; particularly if they are passed Pawns supported by the King. The principles might be stated thus: When the opponent has a Bishop; keep your Pawns on squares of the same color as your opponent's Bishop._ Whenever you have a Bishop; whether the opponent has also one or not; keep your Pawns on squares of the opposite color to that of your own Bishop._ Naturally; these principles have sometimes to be modified to suit the exigencies of the position." },

His only advantage consisted in the undeveloped condition of Black's ♛ ♝. He should therefore have made a plan to prevent the ♝ from coming out, or if that were not possible, then he should try to force Black to weaken his Pawn position in order to come out with the ♝. There were three moves to consider: first,  ♟ - ♛ ♜ 4, in order to maintain the White ♝ in the dominating position that it now occupies. This would have been met by ♛ - ♝ 2; second, either of the Rooks to ♛ 1 in order to threaten 16 ♟ x ♟, ♝ x ♟; 17 ♞ x ♝, ♛ x ♞; 18 ♝ x ♟ ch. This would have been met by ♝ - ♞ 5; and third, ♟ - ♚ ♜ 3 to prevent ♝ - ♞ 5 and by playing either ♜ to ♛ 1, followed up as previously stated to force Black to play ♟ - ♛ ♞ 4, which would weaken his Queen's side Pawns. Thus by playing ♟ - ♚ ♜ 3 White would have attained the desired object. The text move blocks the action of the White ♝ and facilitates Black's development.
